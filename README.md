# Tracklistr
Tracklistr is a web app (in development) where users can paste tracklists from radio and DJ shows and presents the user with a 
song-by-song breakdown of its contents. This allows people to ID songs much quicker, listen to tracks on their own, or play
an entire show without any talking, mixing or adverts.

The app will intelligently process the tracklist to extract the most useful information, in order to generate more accurate results.
Examles of this are "ft.", "&", or "by" which can trip up some search algorithms (looking at you Spotify).

We will initially search only on YouTube as it has the best search algorthm and a well featured API. This will be extended to other
sites, Spotify, Beatport, Discogs, etc...
