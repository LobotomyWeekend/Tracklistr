# Tracklistr
Tracklistr is a web app (in development) where users can paste tracklists from radio and DJ shows and presents the user with a song-by-song breakdown of its contents. This allows people to ID songs much more quickly, listen to tracks on their own, or play an entire show without any talking, mixing or adverts.

The initial version uses the Youtube API to find the most likely results, future versions will have a "look harder" search for tracks which are harder to find.
